					<h2>Guilty Gear Strive</h2>

						<dt>Wild Assault</dt>
						<dd>Wild assault is a lunging move that cost half your Burst Gauge and is used to extend block strings or combos and comes in 3 different colors. The properties and colors of Wild Assault are loosely tied to the character archetype and is done by inputting forward quarter circle + whatever your dust button is. </dd>

						<dd>Orange</dd>
						<br>
						<dd>Fastest startup and used for extending combos</dd>
						
						<dd>White</dd>
						<br>
						<dd>Invincible on startup but moves slowly and is the only Assault that can't be canceled into. Used by big body characters to move through attacks i neutral and guard crush.</dd>
						
						<dd>Blue</dd>
						<br>
						<dd>Used by mostly zoners and is used to setup there offense</dd>
						
						<dt>Deflect Shield</dt>
						<br>

						<br>
						
						<dd>Blue RC</dd>
						<br>
						<dd>This is the color you'll get when you're doing nothing and nothing is happening to you. If the shockwave of the move hits an opponent it'll slow down the opponent for you to react to your opponent or punish them</dd>
