                    <h2>The Creator</h2>
                    <p>My name is Clyric Allen or if you met me through locals/online tourneys you might know me as <a href="https://www.start.gg/user/ec2d2d21/results">ProtoOrCly</a>. I grew up playing fighthing games, from Tekken 2 when I was like 3 yrs old or playing any of the Mortal Kombats with my cousins to today where I enter tournaments every once in awhile and always trying to help new players if I come across them.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Since fighting games are still niche when it comes to people actually playing them I've never had alot of friends who liked playing them. So I wanted to make this site for people who know nothing about fighting games, want to give something digestable to their friend who knows nothing about fightinggames, or someone who is coming from one fighting game to the other.  </p>
